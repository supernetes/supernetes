# This is a helper for automating the approval of the deployment jobs if the actor (triggering user) is trusted. This
# should avoid the need for constantly clicking around manual approvals. Supernetes maintainers should first add
# themselves to the required reviewers of the "deploy" environment, then to the `actor_allow_list` below.
